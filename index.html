            <h2>Game Instructions</h2>
            <p>Welcome to the Haunted House game! üëª <br><br>In this text-based game, you are trapped in a house with an evil ghost. The exit door is locked. You have to find the key, unlock the door, and leave the house. Please read the following instructions carefully! <br><br>
                Here‚Äôs the information that you have:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The house is a 3x3 grid with 9 rooms in total.</li>
                <li>You do not know which room you are currently in.</li>
                <li>The locked exit door is in your starting room.</li>
                <li>The key is in one of the rooms, and the ghost is in a different room.</li>
                <li>You must avoid the ghost - if you enter the same room, the game ends. </li>
            </ul>
                <br><h3>Movement:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>You can move one room at a time. </li>
                <li>You cannot move diagonally.</li>
                <li>To move, simply type the direction you want to go (left, right, up, down).</li>
            </ul>
                <br><h3>Clues:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>When you enter a new room, you will receive a verbal clue. </li>
                <li>If the clue says ‚ÄúThe key is nearby‚Äù, it means that your next move can lead to the room with the key. </li>
                <li>If the clue says ‚ÄúThe ghost is nearby‚Äù, it means that your next move can lead to the room with the ghost.</li>
                <li>There are many other verbal clues so pay close attention to them! </li>
            </ul>
            <p>To start the game, type the first direction you want to move.</p>
